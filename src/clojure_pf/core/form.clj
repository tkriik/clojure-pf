(defn to-forms [tokens]
  "Parses a list of packet field forms from a vector of form tokens.

  A packet field form specifies how values are:
    1. Serialized and deserialized when reading and writing packets.
    2. Handled when compiling packet filtering programs.

  There are 3 types of field forms:
    1. Scalar forms, which associate a scalar value with a field.
    2. Array forms, which associate an array of scalar values with a field.
    3. Subforms, which associate a structure with a field.

  Every field form must start with a keyword denothing the field name.
  The type of a field form is described by the subsequent tokens:
    1. An array field form is composed of, in addition to a field name,
       a keyword denoting a data kind and a number denoting a quantity.
    2. A subform is composed of, in addition to a field name,
       a vector, which must contain one or more field forms.

  The tokens are additionally subject to following constraints:
    1. A data kind must be one of the following keywords:
       :byte, :short, :int, :long, :float, :double
    2. A quantity must be 1 or greater.
    3. A subform must be a list of valid forms according to these same rules.

  The following packet field form list specifies the structure of
  an L2 IPv4-over-Ethernet ARP packet, which contains two subforms
  denoting the structure of an Etherned header and ARP payload, respectively:

  [:eth [:dst   :byte   6 ; array of 6 bytes (MAC address)
         :src   :byte   6
         :type  :short]   ; 16-bit integer
   :arp [:htype :short
         :ptype :short
         :hlen  :byte     ; single byte
         :plen  :byte
         :oper  :short
         :sha   :byte   6
         :spa   :byte   4 ; array of 4 bytes (IPv4 address)
         :tha   :byte   6
         :tpa   :byte   4]]"
  (-> (get-forms tokens)
      first))
